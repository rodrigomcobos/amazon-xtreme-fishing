      'I have been Peacock Bass fishing in Brazil 4 times with Marc. We have never had any problems or issues relating to the travels. It is a long trip getting there, but once you arrive, you are well taken care of. Marc is extremely knowledgeable of the area, the fishing and the current conditions. He has always been well prepared and made the trips enjoyable. I look forward to more trips with Marc in the future.',
